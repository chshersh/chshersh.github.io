\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

I enjoy reading Programming Language books and articles, trying to catch up with modern researches in functional programming. I like to contribute to open-source projects and help beginners to start with implementing easy issues. I answer to StackOverflow questions (mostly in Haskell section) which I found useful both for my self-education and novice programmers. In my free from programming and self-learning time I like playing guitar and eat milk chocolate :)

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
