\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

I enjoy reading Programming Language books and articles to always be in touch with modern research in Functional Programming. In my free time, I contribute to Open-Source, mentor newcomers in my Haskell Beginners 2022 course, and write educational articles where I share my vast knowledge with everyone.

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
