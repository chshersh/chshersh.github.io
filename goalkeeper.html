<p>During many years of open-source development I have come to the helpful habit that severely increases productivity of my work, and greatly increases projects maintainability and sustainability. I also noticed that very few people actually follow the same way of personal project development as I do.</p>
<p>So, in this post I want to share this magical (at least for me) approach, give a few examples and elaborate on why it is important to integrate it into your project development routine.</p>
<p>You may find this blog post useful, if you are interested in maintaining any project for a long time and keep your sanity during this process.</p>
<h2 id="one-goal-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#one-goal-to-rule-them-all" class="anchor">One goal to rule them all</a></h2>
<p>The suggestion itself is rather simple:</p>
<div class="thought">
<p>Define the project goals.</p>
</div>
<p>That’s it. Come up with the goals and write them explicitly somewhere.</p>
<p>The goals can be written either in README.md of your repository, or Wiki for your project, or even some private text document that only you can see. But it is crucial to <strong>set the goals</strong> for your project and <strong>record</strong> them somewhere. And here is why.</p>
<p>Usually, when you create a new project, you have some strong understanding of why you are doing this. The reasons could be absolutely different. You may want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn something new</li>
<li>Experiment with some wild ideas</li>
<li>Solve your specific problem</li>
<li>Try to fill the gap in the language’s ecosystem</li>
<li>Literally anything else!</li>
</ul>
<p>And you have your own unique vision on how you prefer to execute your plan. The desired resulting product could be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight dependencies-wise but yet batteries-included solution</li>
<li>Composable library</li>
<li>All-inclusive framework</li>
<li>Beginner-friendly designed interface</li>
<li>Advanced users targeted package that uses some sophisticated language features and techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as we all are different, we may have different visions of all the above subject areas. Moreover, even your own vision may change over time, and that is normal.</p>
<p>If you have a self-checking note that helps to navigate between many directions of your project, you won’t accidentally change the course. The act of changing the project roadmap will be an explicit action in that case.</p>
<p>In your private projects such a note would help you to find the motivation and perspective on how to proceed with the project to accomplish your goals. However, in the open-source world, other people – users of your project or just curious people – may come and point out that they find something inconvenient or some features lacking. Usually they would visit your bug-tracker and propose some changes. And if those changes do not align with the goals of your project, they should not be accepted.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t write the goals explicitly, people <strong>may impose</strong> the goals for you, and you could spend a lot of time and mental health arguing about some particular proposal trying to convince the opposite side in what you think is better for the project, and they would do the same to you, as there is no clear vision of what is actually right.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you may accept the feature and changes, but as it is not aligned with the goals, it may lead to the issues in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>additional costs to support what you are not interested in</li>
<li>obstacles on the way of implementing some other feature that you need</li>
<li>misunderstanding of how to better serve this feature</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>While doing open-source, I’ve noticed that people usually implicitly assume the following goals for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be the ultimate best-in-class solution for a problem, or don’t exist at all</li>
<li>Cover and provide the support for every use-case, even very specific ones</li>
<li>Implement the project using only “blessed” or “popular” design patterns (by the opinion of each person separately)</li>
<li>Be the most performant solution among all</li>
<li>Satisfy as many users of your library/tool/application as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if all the above goals are noble and reasonable in particular situations, you can easily see how they might be different from your own plans, distract you from the main goals, or sometimes simply impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>But even with the set list of goals in your mind there could be some difficulties. One important thing to consider, when interacting in the open-source world, is the anxiety of rejecting people’s thoughts, notably when they are completely valid and make sense to you generally, but not in the context of a particular project. Even though it is important to say “no” and stick to your goals for the project to succeed, people’s feelings could be hurt when you reject their work, especially if they put effort into it. That is why it is nice to have the goals for your open-source project publically, so people know what to expect, and you can link to that instead of walking on the minefield of people’s emotions.</p>
<hr>
<div class="thought">
<p>Defining goals and priorities helps to triage bug reports and feature requests.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s be honest, many developers do open-source only in their <strong>free time</strong>, unfortunately. It’s already impossible to satisfy <em>everyone</em>. And it’s completely impossible to solve <em>all</em> problems using limited resources. We must always remember that <strong>time and mental health are very limited resources</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can be excited about other people using your solutions, and it is really a great feeling when somebody else finds your work useful and worth depending on! As a consequence, you may spend a lot of time implementing and maintaining features they want. But it is not sustainable to follow others dreams instead of yours.</p>
<p>As an extreme example, <a href="https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything">a repository can accept any PR</a>, but you don’t need to be a psychic to predict what is happening in there.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-determine-goals-for-your-project"><a href="#how-to-determine-goals-for-your-project" class="anchor">How to determine goals for your project?</a></h2>
<p>When starting a new project, I think about the purpose of creating the project and why I want to work on it. It is quite a tricky process that requires time to analyse the given information, capabilities and limits.</p>
<p>I see how hard it sounds, so here are my two cents to help people come up with their goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always try to put realistic goals.</li>
<li>When writing down the goals think about how important and relevant they are to the project.</li>
<li>Do not put anything because it <strong>has to</strong> be in there, you are not obligated to anything you are not personally interested in doing. Believe me, the strong motivation behind each goal is important.</li>
<li>It is okay to adjust goals on the way: an experimental project could become primary, and vice versa as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are only starting doing open-source or maintaining your own project, and struggling with defining goals for your projects, you can learn from other people’s experience. Alternatively, you can follow some established processes for defining goals which are suitable for programming projects as well. An example of such metodology is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">S.M.A.R.T.</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-goals-example"><a href="#project-goals-example" class="anchor">Project goals example</a></h2>
<p>Below is a specific example of the project I’m working on, which defines its goals upfront:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kowainik/Relude">Relude</a> — safe, performant and lightweight Haskell standard library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly, being a standard library for Haskell, the Relude has goals to provide Haskell developers with an interface that increases their productivity and encourages Haskell best-practices, while still being beginner-friendly and easy to use even for experienced users. These goals can be achieved in multiple ways, e.g. by providing a safe and lightweight interface.</p>
<p>I stand by these goals all the time, and Relude goals are even highlighted in its description to indicate that. As the Prelude is a rather important part of any application, through our goals we want to make it easier for users to decide if they would need to replace the default standard library with Relude before committing to long-term relationships.</p>
<p>The project passed the test of time by proving itself useful and convenient to use. And it is the goals that make it successful and help to be productive. So it’s helpful to remind ourselves about the library course.</p>
<p>If you don’t agree with the project goals, you can always just not use it. It is completely fine that some other tool may solve your problem better. And goals tell you what to expect from a particular tool, library or application.</p>
<p>Here are some proofs that this approach works. In Relude we were declining some changes and proposals due to the fact that they were not aligned with our goals. Similarly, we were gladly accepting proposals that make developer lives easier and not contradict with our goals. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not aligned with the goals: <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/relude/issues/330">Non partial Data.Text.head</a></li>
<li>Aligned with the goals: <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/relude/issues/316">Could I add <code>average</code>?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Having goals written severely improved our experience both as Relude users and maintainers.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-goals"><a href="#haskell-goals" class="anchor">Haskell goals</a></h2>
<div class="thought">
<p>What are the Haskell goals really?</p>
</div>
<p>I love Haskell and I feel extremely productive using this programming language. It is totally okay if you disagree and if you feel more comfortable using other tools. We all have different preferences, and, at least in our spare time, we are free to choose what to use. I’m not here to sell Haskell to you, today we are talking about goals only.</p>
<p>And because I enjoy using Haskell, I want this particular programming language to become more approachable, helpful and convenient both for me personally and other potential users of the language as well. And this desire motivates me to contribute towards achieving this goal by doing a lot of open-source in Haskell and for the Haskell ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’m extremely worried about the Haskell future. Not because of some language design decisions, but because I do not completely see where Haskell is moving, and whether the goals and values of the core developers align with my long-term goals and values.</p>
<div class="thought">
<p>I believe it would be beneficial for the whole Haskell community to define goals of Haskell (the language) and GHC (the Haskell compiler).</p>
</div>
<p>To give an example of why I think so, let’s have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals">ghc-proposals</a> repository. It is a place where anyone can propose a change to Haskell, the community is supposed to discuss it, and the committee then will decide to accept or reject the proposal.</p>
<p>I think this is an awesome initiative, where everyone can be involved and improve the language they love, as well as get valuable opinions from other experienced and brilliant Haskell developers at the same time! I love that Haskell evolves and improves over time under the common efforts.</p>
<p>The <code>ghc-proposals</code> readme contains a detailed description of a good proposal, but what it misses is a description of what committee values in the proposals. However, this part seems important in the presence of the following acceptance criterion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For acceptance, a proposal must have at least <em>some</em> enthusiastic support from member(s) of the committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, it is valuable to know many things beforehand to guess what the decision status could possibly be. For example, whether the committee fancy completely new features over syntax changes, or if it is okay to break backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>I feel like the project development is not healthy if instead of depending on some values or goals, it depends more on which party has more time and energy to contribute their vision or which party has more reputation or more power. I’m not saying that this is the case with Haskell. I just want to highlight this thought: having a well-defined roadmap is <strong>better for everyone</strong>.</p>
<p><em>As a Haskell developer</em>, I’m naturally worried that some changes to Haskell may negatively change the way we write the code and work with the language.</p>
<p><em>As an author of a GHC proposal</em>, I’m worried that I will spend a lot of time writing the proposal, thinking about corner cases and discussing the proposal in comments, when it will be rejected eventually because it wasn’t aligned with the Haskell goals from the start.</p>
<p>One possible list of goals for GHC/Haskell can look like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be beginner-friendly.</li>
<li>Allow solving real-life problems in a convenient and expressive way.</li>
<li>Think about language users.</li>
<li>Value UX improvements.</li>
<li>Provide smooth migration plans, when breaking changes are unavoidable.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that the following GHC proposal is a good representer of these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282">RecordDotSyntax language extension proposal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, the following list of goals is also completely valid:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be a platform for academic research and playground for new Programming Languages ideas.</li>
<li>Experiment with new techniques and approaches and see how they can be applied to solving real-world problems.</li>
<li>Allow changing the syntax, if it makes the life of compiler maintainers easier.</li>
<li>Pursue the goal of implementing the ideal language.</li>
</ol>
<p>And I think that this proposal illustrates the above goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/111">Linear types</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While both lists are reasonable, the outcome of having one set of goals is completely different from having another. As a developer or as a researcher you may find one list appealing, while another is less satisfying.</p>
<p>I would like you to think about the following important question we all should ask ourselves:</p>
<div class="thought">
<p>What values in the programming language you find attractive and healthy, so you would like to engage in that community more?</p>
</div>
<p>And maybe together we could help Haskell by establishing some concrete goals.</p>
