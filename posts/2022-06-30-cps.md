While implementing Haskell functions with deeply nested logic, I've
discovered a particular trick that allows writing more modular code by
solving annoying indentation errors at the same time.

The described technique uses the CPS transformation and Haskell layout
parsing rules. It sounds scary but in its core it's just a refactoring
using Higher-Order Functions, no fancy features involved.

## Problem

To understand the solution, let's first look at the problem.

Let's say we're working on the backend part of a web-application. We
want to write a function that associates a user in our system with
with their email if the user doesn't already have an email. To be more
specific, this function should do the following:

1. Take a user session token and get the user ID from it.
2. Check if the given user already has an email.
3. Check if someone else already associated this email with them.
4. If all good, associate the user with an email by inserting the data
   in the database.

In a simplified case, let's say that we already have the following
types and functions:

```haskell
data UserSession = ...
data UserId = ...
data Email = ...
data ID = ...
data InternalDbError = ...

validateUserSession :: UserSession -> IO (Maybe UserId)

getEmailByUserId :: UserId -> IO (Maybe Email)

getUserIdByEmail :: Email -> IO (Maybe UserId)

insertUserEmail :: UserId -> Email -> IO (Either InternalDbError ID)
```

And now we want to glue our API functions together into the following
function and report all possible error cases as well:

```haskell
data AppError
    = UserSessionIsInvalid
    | UserAlreadyHasEmail
    | UserHasDifferentEmail
    | EmailIsTaken
    | DbError InternalDbError

associateEmail :: UserSession -> Email -> IO (Either AppError ID)
```

## Baseline

The simplest and straighforward implementation of the desired function
would be to use all the API methods directly and pattern-match on
their results as we go. This is demonstrated by the following code
snippet:

```haskell
associateEmail :: UserSession -> Email -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email =
    validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
        Nothing -> pure $ Left UserSessionIsInvalid

        Just userId -> getEmailByUserId userId >>= \case
            Just otherEmail
                | email == otherEmail -> pure $ Left UserAlreadyHasEmail
                | otherwise -> pure $ Left UserHasDifferentEmail

            Nothing -> getUserIdByEmail email >>= \case
                Just otherUserId -> pure $ Left EmailIsTaken
                Nothing -> insertUserEmail userId email >>= \case
                    Left dbErr -> pure $ Left $ DbError dbErr
                    Right id' -> pure $ Right id'
```

This simple implementation doesn't use any advanced features and is
easy to read by Haskell beginners. However, it has several problems
that we would like to solve:

+ **The code is deeply nested.** It slowly turns into a weird
  staircase as we add more steps.
+ **It mixes business logic with pesky implementation details.** The
  high-level description of this function has only four clear steps
  but it's extremely difficult to extract them quickly from this
  particular implementation. The problem becomes more severe as you
  add more steps or start introducing more complicated logic
  (e.g. logging, monitoring, etc.).

## Either-isation

A one possible approach to improving the situation would be to
introduce a separate function for each individual step. Those
functions would return `Either AppError smth` and will hide the
implementation details. The code will look like this:

```haskell
checkUserSession :: UserSession -> IO (Either AppError UserId)
checkUserSession userSession = validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
    Nothing -> pure $ Left UserSessionIsInvalid
    Just userId -> pure $ Right userId

checkUserEmail :: UserId -> Email -> IO (Either AppError ())
checkUserEmail userId email = getEmailByUserId userId >>= \case
    Just otherEmail
        | email == otherEmail -> pure $ Left UserAlreadyHasEmail
        | otherwise -> pure $ Left UserHasDifferentEmail
    Nothing -> pure $ Right ()

checkOtherUserEmail :: Email -> IO (Either AppError ())
checkOtherUserEmail email = getUserIdByEmail email >>= \case
    Just otherUserId -> pure $ Left EmailIsTaken
    Nothing -> pure $ Right ()

checkEmailInsert :: UserId -> Email -> IO (Either AppError ID)
checkEmailInsert userId email = insertUserEmail userId email >>= \case
    Left dbErr -> pure $ Left $ DbError dbErr
    Right id'  -> pure $ Right id'

associateEmail
    :: UserSession
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email =
    checkUserSession userSession >>= \case
        Left err -> pure $ Left err
        Right userId -> checkUserEmail userId email >>= \case
            Left err -> pure $ Left err
            Right () -> checkOtherUserEmail email >>= \case
                Left err -> pure $ Left err
                Right () -> checkEmailInsert userId email
```

This refactoring is simple and pretty straightforward but it doesn't
solved any of two problems we have above despite writing much more
code. Though, the code of `associateEmail` became slightly more
understandable due to uniform handling of errors and we're now able to
add more implementation details to each step without polluting the
implementation of `associateEmail`.

## ExceptT

The problem with out-of-control nested indentation annoyed thousands
of Haskell developers even before you and me. In this particular case,
where all your functions return `IO (Either TheSameErrorType
anything)`, you can use the
[`ExceptT` monad transformer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.4/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-Except.html).

I won't go into much details about `ExcepT`. This blog post is not a
monad transformer tutorial. But I'm going to mention this approach as
it's quite common and still pretty basic in terms of language
features.

Once you performed Either-isation of your functions, you can wrap each
function into the `ExceptT` type. This change is quite mechanical in
our case:

```diff
-checkUserSession :: UserSession -> IO (Either AppError UserId)
+checkUserSession :: UserSession -> ExceptT AppError IO UserId
-checkUserSession userSession = validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
+checkUserSession userSession = ExceptT $ validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
```

After applying this refactoring to each function, we can update the
implementation of `associateEmail`:

```haskell
associateEmail
    :: UserSession
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email = runExceptT $ do
    userId <- checkUserSession userSession
    checkUserEmail userId email
    checkOtherUserEmail email
    checkEmailInsert userId email
```

Now we finally solved our both problems! However, at what cost 😢
We've introduced a rather complicated concept of monad transformers to
the codebase which makes the code less beginner-friendly. On top of
that, `ExceptT` brings different problems such as
[broken behaviour when used with concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZIN9f9rI34).

## CPS transformation

The `ExceptT` solution allows us to achieve the desired shape of the
`associateEmail` function but this approach has several
drawbacks. Let's use a different approach —
[Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)
transformation.

The term CPS itself is not modern. It exists since 1975. It's usually
mentioned a lot in compiler development or in relation to
[callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/). However, we're going to put
a new perspective on this good old trick.

The main idea behind the CPS transformation is simple: instead of
returning a value from a function, we take a callback (also called
"continutation") as an argument and run it on the result instead of
returning the result.

For example, here is what we had before:

```haskell
checkUserSession :: UserSession -> IO (Either AppError UserId)
checkUserSession userSession = validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
    Nothing -> pure $ Left UserSessionIsInvalid
    Just userId -> pure $ Right userId
```

And here is `checkUserSession` after applying the CPS transformation:

```haskell
withUserSession
    :: UserSession
    -> (UserId -> IO (Either AppError a))
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
withUserSession userSession next = validateUserSession userSession >>= \case
    Nothing -> pure $ Left UserSessionIsInvalid
    Just userId -> next userId
```

In this transformation, I performed several things:

1. Renamed the function from `checkUserSession` to `withUserSession`
   to convey the intention behind this function: it takes an action to
   be performed "with user session".
2. Added extra argument — continuation — a function of type
   `UserId -> IO (Either AppError a)`. So `withUserSession` is a
   Higher-Order Function now. ⚠️ **Important**: the return type of our
   continuation is polymorphic (as well as the return type of our
   function) to make usage more flexible.
3. Split type signature into multiple lines as it's became longer here.
4. Returned `next userId` instead of `pure $ Right userId` in the end.

Our transformed `withUserSession` function now either short-circuits
with an error or runs a given continuation with `userId` in case of
success. It takes a continuation and passes the result to it, hence
the name — Continuation-Passing Style.

Now, we apply the CPS transformation to every function:

```haskell
withCheckedUserEmail
    :: UserId
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
withCheckedUserEmail userId email next = getEmailByUserId userId >>= \case
    Just otherEmail
        | email == otherEmail -> pure $ Left UserAlreadyHasEmail
        | otherwise -> pure $ Left UserHasDifferentEmail
    Nothing -> next

withCheckedOtherUserEmail
    :: Email
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
withCheckedOtherUserEmail email next = getUserIdByEmail email >>= \case
    Just otherUserId -> pure $ Left EmailIsTaken
    Nothing -> next

withEmailInsert
    :: UserId
    -> Email
    -> (ID -> IO (Either AppError a))
    -> IO (Either AppError a)
withEmailInsert userId email next = insertUserEmail userId email >>= \case
    Left dbErr -> pure $ Left $ DbError dbErr
    Right id'  -> next id'
```

A few notes on the implementation:

* When we don't have a meaningful argument to pass to continuation
  (e.g. the function returns a value of the unit type `()`), we can
  simply pass an action instead of a function.
* `withEmailInsert` will be called last but we still apply the CPS
  transformation to it. This approach is better for composability in
  case we want to use this function in the middle of another function
  and not necessarily in the end.

After we've performed this refactoring, we can now use our
CPS-transformed functions in `associateEmail`. We're going to use the
chain of nested continuations:

```haskell
associateEmail
    :: UserSession
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email =
    withUserSession userSession $ \userId ->
        withCheckedUserEmail userId email $
            withCheckedOtherUserEmail email $
                withEmailInsert userId email $ \id' ->
                    pure $ Right id'
```

What will happen is that `withUserSession` will validate user session
and call the `\userId -> ...` lambda if everything is good. The lambda
starts with the call to `withCheckedUserEmail`. This function will
then check if the user already has an email and call the next action
(starting with `withCheckedOtherUserEmail`) after the validation
passes. And so on.

Wait a minute! You can say that the implementation of `associateEmail`
is still deeply nested and you'll be absolutely right. We see the four
steps clearly but we still have this annoying alignment requirement.

The solution to this problem is simply to not indent the code at all:

```haskell
associateEmail
    :: UserSession
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email =
    withUserSession userSession $ \userId ->
    withCheckedUserEmail userId email $
    withCheckedOtherUserEmail email $
    withEmailInsert userId email $ \id' ->
    pure $ Right id'
```

![Haskell indentation: The Neat part](/images/cps/haskell-indent.jpg)

This works because Haskell parsing rules around layouts are quite
flexible in this case. Semantically, everything "to the right of"
lambda belongs to this lambda. So we don't need this extra indentation
here. This doesn't work for `case-of` expressions and `do`-notation
blocks but surprisingly works for lambdas and arguments after `$`
outside `do` blocks.

You can go one step further in making this code look cleaner.
I'm [not a fan](https://osa1.net/posts/2020-01-22-no-small-syntax-extensions.html)
of the
[BlockArguments](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/block_arguments.html?highlight=blockarguments#extension-BlockArguments)
extension in Haskell but if you like it, you can write the final
function with slightly less operator noise:

```haskell
associateEmail
    :: UserSession
    -> Email
    -> IO (Either AppError ID)
associateEmail userSession email =
    withUserSession userSession \userId ->
    withCheckedUserEmail userId email $
    withCheckedOtherUserEmail email $
    withEmailInsert userId email \id' ->
    pure $ Right id'

```

## Conclusion

In this blog post I've described how you can make code cleaner by
using the fundamental Haskell feature Higher-Order Functions with
combination of 50-years old technique. Sometimes, you don't need fancy
tools to improve your life when fundamentals are solid and already
powerful enough.
