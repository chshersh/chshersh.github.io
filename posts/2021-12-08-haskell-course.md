I'm offering a free beginner-friendly Haskell course!

In this course, I'm going to explain the fundamentals of Functional
Programming (FP), Haskell Syntax and teach you skills for solving
problems in the functional style. No prior knowledge of FP or Haskell
is required!

## When?

The course starts on January 10 (Monday), 2022 and comprises four
1-hour lectures on four consequent weeks. Specifically, the times of
lectures:

* Lecture 1: Jan 10 (Monday), 19:00-20:00 (UTC+0)
* Lecture 2: Jan 17 (Monday), 19:00-20:00 (UTC+0)
* Lecture 3: Jan 24 (Monday), 19:00-20:00 (UTC+0)
* Lecture 4: Jan 31 (Monday), 19:00-20:00 (UTC+0)

## What?

I'm planning to record lectures and may even stream them on YouTube so
they'll be available later.

In addition to lectures, the course contains practical exercises that
you can complete and get my feedback on your solutions.

I'm going to cover the following topics:

* What is FP?
* Lazy evaluation
* Immutability
* Higher-Order Functions
* Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)
* Pattern-matching
* Parametric polymorphism
* Ad-Hoc polymorphism
* Haskell Syntax
* Standard Haskell data types (Maybe, Either, Lists)
* Typeclasses
* Functor
* Applicative
* Monad
* IO
* do-notation

The final goal of this course is for you to be able to write a simple
program in Haskell that interacts with the real world (e.g. search a
substring in a file, count the number of files with the specified
extension, etc.).

If you complete all home exercises by the end of the course you get
enough Haskell knowledge to start solving real problems. You'll also
receive a pretty PDF certificate about the course completion 💝

## What do I need for the course?

To attend the course, you need:

* Zoom account. Lectures will be given via Zoom.
* GitHub account. Home exercises will be found and verified on GitHub.
    * As a consequence, some basic git knowledge is required: forking
      repositories, committing changes and pushing them.
* Telegram account (optional). A Telegram group will be created for
  all participants to discuss the course, exercises and solutions.

## How to apply?

If you're interested in listening to the course and doing exercises,
apply using the following form:

* [Apply for Haskell Beginners 2022 Course](https://forms.gle/JAeJVDSq5L8kUPGT6)

> **Privacy notice**: I won't share your applications with anyone.

I especially encourage minorities in tech to apply. They'll be given a
preference during the attendees' slot allocation. However, you're not
forced to disclose any specific details about yourself (or any details
at all).

I'm planning to give the course to a maximum of 100
participants. However, I'll give the course anyway even if only a
single person applies.

The application form closes on December 30.

I'll send emails with application results by January 2, 23:59:59 (UTC+0).

## How much should I pay for the course?

Nothing. The course is free to apply and attend.
